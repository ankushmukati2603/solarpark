                        <p class="mb-10"><b>A.</b> Biogas is a combustible gaseous fuel that is collected from the
                            microbial degradation of organic matter in anaerobic conditions (without oxygen). Biogas is
                            principally a mixture of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (C02) along with other trace
                            gases. Biogas can be collected from landfills, covered lagoons, or enclosed tanks called
                            anaerobic digesters. The biogas typically has 60% methane and 35% carbon di oxide. There is
                            also some percentage of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, ammonia, moisture etc.<a>(1. BDTC)</a>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Biogas production is obtained by anaerobic decomposition (absence of
                            oxygen) of biomass in the presence of bacteria. The bacterial decomposition of biomass takes
                            place in three phases, namely hydrolysis phase, acid phase and methane phase.<a>(9.

                            decay (principally animals and plants). Wasted or spoiled food, plant clippings, animal
                            manure, meat trimmings and sewage are common types of organic material used with anaerobic
                            digestion. In contrast, inorganic material includes things like rocks, dirt, plastic, metal

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Biogas is commonly made from animal slurry, sludge settled from
                            wastewater and at landfills containing organic wastes. However, biogas can also be made from
                            almost any organic waste has the ability to produce biogas: human excreta, slurry, animal
                            slurry, fruit and vegetable waste, slaughterhouse waste, meat packing waste, dairy factory
                            waste, brewery and distillery waste, etc. Fiber rich wastes like wood, leaves, etc. make
                            poor feed stocks for digesters as they are difficult to digest. Many wastewaters contain
                            organic compounds that may be converted to biogas including municipal wastewater, food
                            processing wastewater and many industrial wastewaters. Solid and semi-solid materials that
                            include plant or animal matter can be converted to biogas.<a> (3. BDTC)</a></p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Organic matter anaerobically decomposed in the presence of bacteria.
                            The bacterial decomposition of organic matter takes place in three phases namely hydrolysis,
                            acid phase and methane phase. In the hydrolysis phase, heavier hydrocarbons are broken into
                            smaller molecules, which are then converted to organic acids by acid forming bacteria. In
                            the methane phase, fermentation of acids, hydrogen and CO2 produces methane.<a> (4.

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> In case of appropriate operation, a biogas plant does not release any
                            bad odour into the environment. Hydrogen sulphide produced in the course of decomposition is
                            converted to odourless elementary sulphur biologically or chemically in a closed space. Only
                            incoming substrates (like manure, organic waste, etc.) can be a source of unpleasant smell.
                            In the course of biogas production, microorganisms use the components of manure for their
                            vital processes, which are responsible for bad smell, so the final product (fermentation
                            effluent) is practically odourless, and it is a good-quality fertilizer for the
                            vegetation.<a> (19. BDTC)</a></p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Biogas shouldn't be breath. Due to its methane content (a flammable
                            gas), it should be dealt with in a safe and secure manner. Some of the trace gases that make
                            up about 1% or less of biogas are acidic and can be corrosive to certain kinds of metals and

                        <b>Q. Is a biogas facility dangerous?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> A biogas plant is a closed system, and the biogas produced therein
                            remains within the system, so if plant operation is done with due care and caution, neither
                            the workers nor the environment is endangered. Even if methane escaped into the atmosphere
                            there would be no serious explosion hazard, since methane is lighter than air. According to
                            its characteristics, biogas mixes easily with air. An air biogas mixture containing 5%
                            methane is explosive, but if a higher air concentration is reached (above 15%), biogas is
                            not flammable anymore. The oxygen concentration in the anaerobic digesters is so low that
                            the content is safe. <a>(90. BDTC)</a></p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> One of the gases produced by the decomposition of slurry is methane
                            gas, which is estimated to trap 20 to 30 times as much atmospheric heat as carbon dioxide
                            and reducing methane releases into the air is a crucial element of fight to limit the global
                            warming. The important substance for plant growth is nitrogen, which remains in place after
                            extraction of biogas. This leads to further environmental advantages. By reducing the weight
                            and volume of fertilizer and increasing the amount of fertilizer available from composted
                            waste reduces the need for chemical fertilizers, which release the extremely powerful

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> During combustion of biogas, carbon dioxide (C02) is released that is
                            reabsorbed by plant matters for their growth. Carbon in biogas comes from plant matter that
                            fixed this carbon from atmospheric C02. Thus, biogas production is carbon-neutral and does
                            not add to greenhouse gas emissions. Further, any consumption of fossil fuels replaced by
                            biogas will lower CO2 emissions.<a>(13. BDTC)</a></p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> A biogas plant is like an animal. You must feed it every day and feed
                            it with appropriate feedstock in the adequate amount. Just like an animal if you don’t take
                            good care of it, it will become ill and will yield poor results. <a>(MNRE)</a></p>
                        <b>Q. What are the optimum conditions for the biogas plant to operate?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The temperature should be in the range of 35 to 38 °C with the input
                            slurry pH of 6.5 to 7.5. In the low temperature regions either hot water can be added to the
                            input slurry or the digester can be insulated with a hot water jacket.<a>(MNRE)</a></p>
                        <b>Q. How waste should be fed to the biogas plant?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The feedstock should be mixed with water in the ratio of 1:1, made
                            into slurry form and then can be fed to biogas plant. It majorly depends on the total solids
                            content of waste materials. The optimum total solids content of the waste material should be
                            8-10% for the better activity of microorganisms. <a>(MNRE)</a></p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No. The biogas has to be purified by removing the Carbon dioxide and
                            Hydrogen Sulphide using scrubbing process and then it can be used in engines.<a>(MNRE)</a>

                            efficiency will often not be as good as with a genuine biogas stove. However, this should be

                            <p class="mb-20">If there is very little biogas, there may be a leak somewhere. The biogas
                                gas holder and biogas pipeline should be checked for leakage. A simple soap solution can
                                be used to detect the leakage.</p>
                            <li>B. Temperature problems</li>
                            <p class="mb-20">If ambient temperatures reach below 200C, you will experience a drastic
                                decrease in biogas production. If this is the case, look to adapt a heating system to
                                your biodigester. </p>
                            <li>C. Problems with the biodigester's pH</li>
                            <p class="mb-20">The pH in the biodigester tank should be as close to neutral as possible.
                                Since the anaerobic processes in a biodigester produce acids. The most common pH problem
                                is one of acidity. Beneficiary can do a simple litmus test on the biodigesters content.
                                If the results are below 7, beneficiary must add a small amount of lime or grounded lime
                                stone to normalize the digester's pH. Since excessive amounts of lime will not be
                                soluble in the mixture and may harm the bacteria, beneficiary should never exceed a lime
                                concentration of 500mg for every litre of mixture in the biodigester tank.</p>
                            <li>D. Other problems</li>
                            <p class="mb-20">There are a number of other problems that can arise during the life of a
                                biodigester. To investigate problems, it is best to think back to the basics of what
                                makes a biodigester work (organic material, strong seals, warmth) and eliminate anything
                                else that could possibly harm its functioning. For example be careful not to introduce
                                unnecessary chemicals into the tank, and try not to use livestock that has recently been
                                given antibiotics or other medications, for these chemicals present in the manure may
                                cause damage to the bacteria in the biodigester tank. Also, make sure to use
                                non-corrosive materials for handling the gas and water. Cement and plastic cause no harm
                                to the mixture in the tank, but metals should be avoided for use in the tank, or any of
                                the tubing through which the biogas travels.<a>(58. BDTC)</a> </p>

                            can be examined by fixing a U-shaped safety valve made of glass tube at the gas outlet pipe
                            and then filling the digester with water or inflating with air using a manually operated air
                            pump to make the column of water in safety valve rise to at least 90 cm. After 24 hours, the
                            water column should be checked for a drop in level. If water column drops or gas escapes,
                            the leak must be located by pouring soap water on all suspected locations outside the gas
                            chamber and around the gas vent pipe joints. <a>(60. BDTC)</a></p>

                            in it overnight. It can be put to a smoke test by burning a cloth dipped in kerosene inside
                            the holder and watching for the smoke coming out of any joints. Only the tested and painted

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The slurry should be added only after the production of inflammable
                            gas has started, i.e. after about 20 days from initial filling of the plant up to the
                            recommended level. The stirring can be done in a fixed dome plant by moving a bamboo pole up
                            and down in the inlet and outlet openings. This will help in breaking of scum if done at

                        <b>Q. Is the first gas flammable?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The production of gas after filling of the gas chamber would take
                            about 7-20 days. The initial gas stored may not be combustible and should be allowed to
                            escape. Purge air from all delivery lines by allowing gas to flow out prior to first use.
                            Ensure that condensed water is able to flow out from the pipeline through the water

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The optimum temperature for bacteria to remain alive and multiply is
                            above 30 to 38 degrees Celsius. Digesters can also work at temperatures that are both lower
                            and higher than this. Because the bacteria working in the digester are very sensitive to
                            temperature, cooler digesters take more time to break down the biodegradable feedstock,
                            while hotter ones may not break down the biodegradable feedstock due to bacteria remaining

                            slurry. It is therefore necessary to develop suitable equipment for handling the slurry and
                            for field application. A few equipments which are in use at different places are as follows:

                        <p class="mb-20"> For the effective use of slurry, a beneficiary must use the liquid slurry as
                            far as possible. After the application of liquid slurry, excess slurry can be dried in open
                            sun condition. The dried slurry can be converted in to powder form by hitting wooden
                            bamboos. The dried powder can be used in the next sowing period.<a>(70. BDTC)</a> </p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> From the outlet of the tank, a channel leads Biogas slurry to a
                            filter bed with opening at both ends. A compact layer of green or dry leaves is made in the
                            filter bed. Biogas slurry flows down and gets filtered allowing the preparing fresh slurry.
                            The semi solid residue left on top of the bed can be transported and stored in a pit use
                            when required. <a>(71. BDTC)</a></p>

                        <b>Q. Is there any harm in handling the slurry manually? </b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No. there is no harm in handling the slurry manually as it is free
                            from pathogens which otherwise causes diseases. Most of the harmful organisms like eggs of
                            hookworms are killed in the process of anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the pathogen, which
                            pollutes the ground water gets eliminated. <a>(72. BDTC)</a></p>
                        <b>Q. What are different types of Biogas slurry? </b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Liquid biogas slurry: It has a solid content about 6%, pH value of
                            about 8 to 9 and nitrogen 1.8% along with other nutrients. This is the best form for use.
                            Semi Dried biogas slurry: It is with solids varying from 15 to 20%, pH value varies from 7
                            to 9%.This is the next best form for use. Dry biogas slurry: The slurry coming out from the
                            plant remains in drying pit for some period without application. The solids vary from 50 to
                            70% and the pH value from 7 to 8. Dry slurry micronutrients but very less as it lost if sun
                            dried.<a>(73. BDTC)</a> </p>
                        <b>Q. When dung and other fertilizers are available than why biogas slurry alone is
                            preferred?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Fermentation reduces the C/N ratio by removing some of the carbon,
                            which has the advantage of increasing the fertilizing effect. Another favourable effect is
                            that nitrogen and other plant nutrients become mineralizes and hence more readily available
                            to plants. Moreover, well digested slurry is practically odourless, easier to spread and
                            does not attract weeds and insects flies. The following table indicates how biogas slurry is
                            more effective than other organic slurries in relation to NPK.<a>(74. BDTC)</a> </p>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The management of slurry is very important in the effective
                            utilization. At present the users just allow biogas slurry to enter lower surface areas
                            resulting in loss of nitrogen. The slurry will be effective if only farmer uses it properly.
                            The farmers are still not aware of the value of biogas slurry and resort to the traditional
                            ways of using the biogas slurry with the agriculture/farm/ cattle waste.<a>(83. BDTC)</a>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Bio - CNG can be injected into the gas network or I compressed for
                            use in natural gas vehicles. Once fed in the gas network, it can provide domestic or
                            commercial cooking and heating, or be used as vehicle fuel in locations remote from the
                            source of I the gas.<a>(95. BDTC)</a> </p>
                        <b>Q. Is Biogas a kind of renewable energy? </b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Yes, anaerobic digester technology is employed world-wide to create
                            renewable energy. Biogas produced from an anaerobic digester is comprised primarily of
                            methane gas, which can be used instead of fossil fuels to produce energy. This "renewable
                            natural gas" can substitute fossil fuel natural gas for any need including heating, cooking
                            and motive power. Biogas can also be used as fuel to make clean electricity. All of these
                            options provide us with the opportunity to turn organic "waste" and into a valuable
                            renewable energy resource in a sustainable manner.<a>(96. BDTC)</a> </p>

                            headway in the states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Diu-Daman? </b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> There is an ample potential of biogas plant installation in these
                            states. Gujarat has already covered more than 70% of its estimated potential whereas
                            Rajasthan and Diu-Daman have still a lot of scope to work upon. The biogas technology can
                            play an important role in rural and semi urban sectors for fuel and fertilizer production
                            apart from sanitation and environmental benefits in urban areas. Waste recycling through
                            biomethanation is a promising option for electricity generation. The climatic conditions are

                            living in the same house right now; house and land are in the name of father. Can we build
                            individual plant on our account/name? Due to lack of real answers to the above questions at
                            the departmental level, many plants are not able to be built. What should we do? It is true
                            that once a beneficiary runs a plant, and later on he feels shortage of fuel. For this, a
                            suitable decision can be taken by giving the detailed explanation in written by the
                            beneficiary in the construction department with all the information. At present there are no

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No. As the biogas plant functions at a temperature of 35 – 40 °C
                            under anaerobic condition, any bacteria or virus present in it will be denatured. Also, this
                            causes the weed seeds to be dormant and prohibit the weed growth when applied to the

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> This problem is mainly due to three reasons in Deenbandhu plant first
                            due to change in quantity and quality of Daily feeding, the pipe joints open it selves and

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Bricks, cement, sand, concrete, is required for construction of a
                            biogas plant. PVC or asbestos pipe is used for inlet and outlet as required. For KVIC biogas
                            plant, additional GI sheets are needed for fabrication of gas holder. (Table 2 & Table 5.)
                            Recently, HDPI material based readymade biogas products are available in market. They could
                            be used for biomethanation. <a>(34. BDTC)</a></p>

                        <b>Q. Why the gas holder portion is painted with di-epoxy paint?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The conventional method of repairing is either with applying oil
                            paint or tar coat over plastering. The inner surface has not proved to be result oriented as
                            a film of oil paint is too thin and tar does not have good bonding with any cemented surface
                            and even new plaster also develops cracks and peels off due to change in compressive
                            strength between the old and new plaster. Epoxy paint has two part- a Hardener and Resin.
                            Both are mixed in equal ratio for application. After application, it becomes a thin harder
                            surface that enables gas to escapes from cracks. <a>(37. BDTC)</a> </p>

                            at many landfills, wastewater plants. However, many opportunities for biogas production are
                            yet to be implemented. Until recently, the low cost of fossil fuels has hindered
                            implementation of biogas production. There is a limited awareness of the potential and
                            advantages of biogas production by citizens, government officials, and in the business
                            sector that has limited interest in biogas production. More education, demonstration and
                            investment in biogas technology would help overcome these barriers.<a>(45. BDTC)</a> </p>
                        <b>Q. Is there any role of earth condition in laying foundation for biogas plant?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Of course, if the earth is sandy, hard brick ballast is laid by an
                            ordinary procedure using cement, sand and brick ballast (1:4:8) or cement, sand and gravel
                            mortar (1:2:4) without reinforced. If during wet earth is observed, there is a possibility
                            of water seepage through the ordinary laid foundation in rainy season. Therefore, under
                            these circumstances, a 75 mm thick layer of dry brick ballast (without cement) is spread and
                            is well compacted. Above this a 150 mm thick layer of cement, sand and brick ballast at a
                            ratio of 1:4:8 is laid. In this layer a net of steel rods of 15 mm diameter (tied by binding
                            wire) bound at a distance of 10.5cm each is also used as reinforcement.<a>(49. BDTC)</a>

                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> The size of the pipe depends upon the distance between the plant and
                            the kitchen. The greater the distance, the larger should be the diameter of the pipe. With
                            the pressure of approximately 8 cm water column, one cubic meter biogas can be transported
                            in one hour in a 12mm pipe over about 20m, in a 19mm pipe over about 150m and in a 25mm pipe

                        <b>Q. How beneficial is the family type biogas plant per family, financially?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Usually, it takes one hour for a person to pour cow dung solution
                            daily in a family biogas plant. Whereas in turn, the maximum usage of gas is 0.31 cubic
                            meter per person per day with a LPG equivalent value of Rs.7.50 for 0.2 kg and the
                            equivalent value of NPK in biogas fertilizer from dung is Rs. 5.00, thus approximately Rs
                            12.5 is daily savings per person per day.</p>
                        <b>Q. Do any of the authorized banks provide financial assistance in the form of a compulsory
                            loan for the construction of the plant or does the construction agency help in getting loan
                            from the bank?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No, at present most of the banks do not provide separate loan for
                            construction of family biogas plant. There are no clear guidelines by the authorized banks.
                            The manufacturing agency also does not cooperate in getting plant construction loan from the
                            bank, although this decision is within the jurisdiction of the bank. Therefore, the farmer
                            can get the plant constructed by taking a general loan or agricultural loan.</p>
                        <b>Q. Currently how does the central government calculate the subsidy on the plant?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> According to the central government guidelines, a plant with a
                            capacity of 2 cubic meters is required to meet the fuel requirement of a 5 member’s family.
                            Considering this the basis actual value is calculated to provide 45% to 50 % for providing
                            subsidy. At the meantime, many state governments are also provides different assistance.</p>
                        <b>Q. Whether beneficiary should get grant according to capacity on construction of family type
                            biogas plant?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Capacity wise decision on biogas plant subsidy can be taken jointly
                            by the central and the state government.</p>
                        <b>Q. Does the central government revise the grant amount every year with the value of inflation
                            rate?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No, yet the central government amends the grant amount in 5 years or
                            more.</p>
                        <b>Q. What is the reason, why biogas plant is relatively less built or not and what measures
                            should be taken for this?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Although it depends on the wishes of the farmer, mainly the farmer
                            needs lump sum financial assistance at the time of construction while the grant money also
                            gets after the construction because the middle and small farmers are not so financially
                            capable while Other means of the fuel become available at monthly expense, compared to being
                            able to construct it, at a reasonable cost.</p>
                        <b>Q. After knowing the benefits of biogas plant at the village level, due to less publicity,
                            why most of the farmers are still not fully aware of its construction and operation?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> Through the limited resources of the agency working in the state
                            government, this program has been going on for the past many years, so basically the farmers
                            have some information. Currently many self-employed workers are also working in this area.
                            Information through new telecommunications also can be obtained.</p>
                        <b>Q. What is the expected action if many plants remain non-functional due to construction
                            shortcomings or lack of proper selection of beneficiaries?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> It depends on the construction agency and the beneficiary, but
                            according to the central government's plan, the plant is built by the construction agency in
                            a guarantee of 5 years, in which case the beneficiary should get the construction faults
                            with the help of the construction agency.</p>
                        <b>Q. Does after conducting a survey at the village or panchayat level by the central government
                            before gives an annual target to the village for producing biogas plant?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No, their targets are set based on the demand of construction
                            agencies working in the districts of the state.</p>
                        <b>Q. Can the project be run smoothly by the construction agency through the sarpanch and
                            secretary of the gram panchayat?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> There is scope for this because the number of employees in the
                            construction agency is limited, so it can be run well through the sarpanch and village
                            secretary of the gram panchayat as they are regular in contact with villagers.</p>
                        <b>Q. Are there any technical institutions of the State Government in the states that
                            continuously monitor the work of the working agencies?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No, most of the state government has no technical institution.</p>
                        <b>Q. Does the agencies working in states are under central government?</b>
                        <p class="mb-20"><b>A.</b> No, it is appointed by the state government.</p>
